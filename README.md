# HTML_CSS_JavaScript_GuessingGridGame

There is a spot on the grid that if you guess wrong will cause you to loose the game that is generated at random each game. You must try select all spots without landing on the X
and a progress bar will let you know how close you are to winning.
You need only to choose and enter your grid position, then click Submit button to play.

Best of luck...
